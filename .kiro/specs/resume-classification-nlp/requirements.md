# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Automated Resume Classification System is a production-ready application that automatically categorizes resumes into job categories using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques. The system will process PDF resumes, extract and clean text content, apply machine learning models for classification, and provide a user-friendly web interface for batch processing with automated file organization and results export.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an HR professional, I want to upload multiple PDF resumes and have them automatically classified into job categories, so that I can quickly organize and filter candidates based on their relevant experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads one or more PDF files THEN the system SHALL extract text content from each resume
2. WHEN text extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL preprocess the text by removing URLs, emails, special characters, and stop words
3. WHEN preprocessing is complete THEN the system SHALL classify each resume into one of 25 predefined job categories
4. WHEN classification is complete THEN the system SHALL display results with confidence scores for each resume
5. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL organize files into category-specific folders automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the system to achieve high classification accuracy using multiple ML algorithms, so that the automated categorization is reliable and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes resumes THEN it SHALL achieve at least 90% classification accuracy
2. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL compare at least 5 different ML algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes)
3. WHEN model comparison is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically select the best performing model based on evaluation metrics
4. WHEN classification is performed THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for each prediction
5. WHEN model evaluation is conducted THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle text preprocessing comprehensively, so that the ML models receive clean, standardized input data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing resume text THEN the system SHALL remove URLs using regex patterns
2. WHEN processing resume text THEN the system SHALL strip email addresses and phone numbers
3. WHEN processing resume text THEN the system SHALL eliminate special characters and extra whitespace
4. WHEN processing resume text THEN the system SHALL convert all text to lowercase
5. WHEN processing resume text THEN the system SHALL remove stop words using NLTK
6. WHEN processing resume text THEN the system SHALL handle encoding issues gracefully
7. WHEN text preprocessing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing other resumes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business user, I want a web-based interface that is intuitive and provides real-time feedback, so that I can easily use the system without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL provide a Streamlit-based web interface
2. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop functionality for multiple PDFs
3. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress bars and status updates
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL show classification results with confidence scores
5. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL provide CSV export functionality
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages to the user
7. WHEN processing large batches THEN the system SHALL complete processing in under 5 seconds per resume

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use TF-IDF vectorization for feature engineering, so that text data is converted into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing feature engineering THEN the system SHALL use TF-IDF vectorization with max features of 5000
2. WHEN configuring TF-IDF THEN the system SHALL use n-gram range of (1, 2) for unigrams and bigrams
3. WHEN applying TF-IDF THEN the system SHALL implement min/max document frequency filtering
4. WHEN vectorization is complete THEN the system SHALL save the trained vectorizer for production use
5. WHEN processing new resumes THEN the system SHALL use the saved vectorizer for consistent feature extraction

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want comprehensive data management and model persistence, so that the system can be reliably deployed and maintained in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training is complete THEN the system SHALL save the best model using pickle format
2. WHEN models are saved THEN the system SHALL persist the TF-IDF vectorizer and category mappings
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load saved models and vectorizers automatically
4. WHEN processing datasets THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and format
5. WHEN managing categories THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent category mapping across sessions
6. WHEN handling file operations THEN the system SHALL create organized directory structures for categorized resumes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing and error handling, so that the system is robust and reliable in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the system THEN it SHALL include unit tests for all core functions with >80% code coverage
2. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL handle various PDF formats and encoding issues gracefully
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL maintain error rate below 5% on diverse resume formats
5. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL use less than 2GB for batch processing
6. WHEN testing integration THEN the system SHALL validate the complete pipeline from upload to categorization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want comprehensive documentation and deployment readiness, so that the system can be easily understood, maintained, and deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow PEP 8 compliance standards
2. WHEN functions are implemented THEN they SHALL include comprehensive docstrings and type hints
3. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include detailed README with setup instructions
4. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include usage examples and screenshots
5. WHEN deployment is considered THEN the system SHALL be ready for both local and cloud environments
6. WHEN performance is evaluated THEN it SHALL include benchmarks and analysis documentation
